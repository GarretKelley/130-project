			<p>Left click to mark a cell as active.</p>
			<p>Right click to mark a cell as inactive.</p>
			<P>The numbers on the outside of the grid indicate # of active cells in a row
				in sequence. for example - in a 7x7 grid with the number 5  on the
				outside of a row, then there is a group of 5 active squares with no spaces
				between them.
			</P>
			<p> If there is more than 1 number for a row/column then there are multiple
				groups of active cells, separated by at least 1 unactive cell.
			</p>
			<p>The game is complete when all squares are marked active or inactive.</p>
